                <p>"A picture's worth a thousand words". How much are moving pictures worth?</p>
                <p>I started playing video games when I was five years old, and they mean the world to me. Because of them, I've connected with my family members and friends, made new friends, and met people I'll cherish for the rest of my life.</p>
                <p>To some, video games are boring, considered a waste of time, or just something they aren't interested in. To me, they're just as much a way of life as reading and writing, two of my other hobbies. Video games tell poignant stories (or maybe silly ones) and let you interact with the imaginary worlds only the most creative of folks can come up with.</p>
                <p>Having spent the last 15 years of my life gaming, I want to share that now. This place serves as a catalogue of some of the games I've played, a place for me to recommend (or warn you away from) games, or for me to just talk about them.</p>
                <p>I do hope you enjoy the time you spend here. Cheers!</p>
